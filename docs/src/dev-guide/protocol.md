# signal-cli Protocol

signal-tui communicates with signal-cli using
[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) over stdin/stdout. signal-cli
is spawned as a child process in `jsonRpc` mode.

## Starting signal-cli

signal-cli is launched with:

```sh
signal-cli -a +15551234567 jsonRpc
```

This starts signal-cli in JSON-RPC mode, reading requests from stdin and writing
responses/notifications to stdout. Each message is a single JSON line.

## Request format

Requests sent from signal-tui to signal-cli:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "method": "send",
    "params": {
        "recipient": ["+15551234567"],
        "message": "Hello!"
    }
}
```

Each request has a unique UUID `id` for response correlation.

## Response format

Responses from signal-cli for RPC calls:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "result": { ... }
}
```

Or on error:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "error": {
        "code": -1,
        "message": "error description"
    }
}
```

## Notification format

Notifications are unsolicited JSON-RPC requests from signal-cli (no matching
outbound request). They have a `method` field but no `id`:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "receive",
    "params": {
        "envelope": {
            "source": "+15559876543",
            "sourceDevice": 1,
            "timestamp": 1700000000000,
            "dataMessage": {
                "message": "Hey there!",
                "timestamp": 1700000000000
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Methods used

### Outbound (signal-tui -> signal-cli)

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `send` | Send a message to a contact or group |
| `listContacts` | Request the contact address book |
| `listGroups` | Request the list of groups |
| `sendSyncRequest` | Request a sync from the primary device |

### Inbound notifications (signal-cli -> signal-tui)

| Method | Purpose | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `receive` | Incoming message | `SignalEvent::MessageReceived` |
| `receiveTyping` | Typing indicator | `SignalEvent::TypingIndicator` |
| `receiveReceipt` | Delivery/read receipt | `SignalEvent::ReceiptReceived` |

## Parsing logic

The stdout reader in `SignalClient` determines the message type by checking
which fields are present:

1. If `method` is present -> it's a notification, parse based on method name
2. If `id` and `result`/`error` are present -> it's a response, look up the
   method via `pending_requests[id]` and parse accordingly
3. Unknown methods are logged and discarded

## Sync messages

Messages sent from the primary device arrive as sync messages. They are
identified by having `is_outgoing = true` in the parsed `SignalMessage`.
The `destination` field indicates the recipient, and the message is routed
to the appropriate conversation.
